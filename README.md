# Chakravyuh
Graph based ML engineering collaboration platform. Following are its key features:
* Features management
* Feature tracking & versioning
* Feature composing using group/set
* Dataset management
* Dataset tracking & versioning
* Model training & tracking with in built versioning support
* Hyper parameter tracking with in built versioning support
* Built on APIs first design paradigm
* Discover ML Model
* Rank ML Model
* Register a ML Model
* Attach ML model to user
* Pointer to where ML is stored
* ..... ....

### What its not?
* Not a store of dataset
* Not a store feature values
* Not hyper parameter tuning framework
* Not a ML model store

### What it is?
* Composable features creation based on set theory â€“ group/set
* Feature strongly typed to data frame/schema registry
* Pointer to data location (s3 etc)
* Record/Track execution based on hyper parameters
* Versioning management as first class citizen of design
* Generate OAS 3.0 specification from features (used by model serving layer)
* Extract feature from Data Frame via reactive REST API
* ....... ....

## Why name [Chakravyuh](http://mahabharata-research.com/military%20academy/the%20mysterious%20chakravyuha.html)?

The name comes Indian mythological epic Mahabharata. In short, it means an **_Invincible_** circle. This project aim to make an invincible ML engineering circle of interpretation easy, like lineage tracking, feature management and more, while performing ML chores using the power of graph theory.
